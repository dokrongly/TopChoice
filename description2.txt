My specialized training method is highly effective for all behavioural problems.  I can fix issues 
other trainers can't such as jumping, barking, pulling, leash aggression and certain types of 
anxiety. Pulaski Method training is based on the concept that high energy behaviors (Fear, 
Aggression, Hyperactivity) are caused by the dog stimulating the production of Adrenaline and 
other high energy chemicals. On the other hand, CALM DOGS are under the influence of Serotonin 
and other low energy chemicals.

<br><br>Our training uses no chemicals or drugs.  The TRAINING PROCESS gets dogs out of high 
energy states of mind and into calm states of mind.

<br><br>This concept of brain chemical reduction and stimulation (through training, not drugs) 
makes the Pulaski Method fundamentally different from other training methods. Through advanced 
training protocols, leadership and communication with the dog we show you how to change your 
dog's energy state instantly for calm, controlled behavior.
