	High-adrenaline behaviors such as jumping, barking etc are easily trained away with our unique
     science-based training method.  I use biological and bio-chemical triggers to interrupt 
     unwanted behaviors, and dog psychology to teach & reinforce new ones. Pulaski Method is 
     entirely different from any training you have ever seen.  Where other trainers take weeks 
     or even months and get fairly limited results, this method takes only a few hours and 
     transforms your dog the first time.
